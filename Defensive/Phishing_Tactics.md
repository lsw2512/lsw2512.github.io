## Spear phishing
This is like a normal phishing attack, however the attacker gets information on the target, before launching the attack.

## Impersonation
This is pretending to be someone the victim knows to get them to trust the malicious email.

## Typosquatting
This is when you purposely misspell a name to make it look legitimate. For example putting a capital I (i) to pretend it's a lowercase l (L). This can trich someone into thinking a fake domain is legitimate.

## Homograph
This uses letters from different character sets that look the same but have different unicode codes.

## Sender Spoofing
This technique is the process of making the sending address of an email look like a legitimate email.

You do this by editing the From: address. This isn't verified when you send an email.

## HTML Styling
This is when HTM coding is used to style an email. This helps the email look more professional and legitimate.
```
<a> </a> – Anchor tags allow for items (such as text or buttons) to be hyperlinked to a web resource.
<table> </table> – Table tags can be used for spacing or tables that include text or images. These are typically used to structure an email into different sections.
<b> </b> – Bold tags can allow text to be formatted as bold.
<I> </I> – Italic tags can allow text to be formatted as italic.
<u> </u> – Underline tags can allow text to be underlined.
```

## Email Attachments
Three different files could be sent: non malicious (used for social engineering), Non malicious which have malicious hyperlinks or malicious files.

## Hyperlinks
Hyperlinks can be sent in an email or attachment. They can be used for many different techniques, like taking the target to a webpage to download malware or credential harvesting.

## URL-Shorteners
- This is a tactic for shortening URLS, to hide their true address.
- A way to do this is to use https://bitly[.]com
- To see where a shortened url goes, use an online service like wannabrowser. This lets you visit the site without worrying if it is malicious or not.

## Using Legitimate services
Attackers use legitimate services since administrators wont block popular domains like ‘@gmail.com’

## Business Email Compromise
- An attacker will gather date on relationships between businesses which transfer money to each other.
- Once they have enough knowledge, they will comprimist a email account, and spoof the email so they can tell the other business to direct their payments to a different account (an account owned by the attacker)
- This is a simple attack that is very successful since it exploits human nature to trust.
