## Explanation

Threat intelligence is information that an organization uses to understand the threats that are currently targeting them, or could target them in the future.

## Threat Intelligence Lifecycle
###  Planning and direction
- Determines scope 
- Set goals
- Define stakeholders
### Collection
- Collect as much data as required to meet the goal.
### Processings
- Collected data needs to be processed into a readable format.
### Analysis
- The information needs to be analysed to get a detailed report of what has been found out and what needs to be done
- This must be in a format suitable for who it will get passed on to
### Dissemination
This involves getting the information to where it needs to go to.

For each of these audiences, you need to ask:

- What threat intelligence do they need, and how can external information support their activities?
- How should the intelligence be presented to make it easily understandable and actionable for that audience?
- How often should we provide updates and other information?
- Through what media should the intelligence be disseminated?
- How should we follow up if they have questions?


### Feedback
You need regular feedback to make sure your collecting the correct intelligence or how you can improve the intelligence you gather.

## Types of Threat Intelligence
### Strategic Threat Intelligence
- High level, non-technical information.
- Used when presenting to executives and decision makers

### Operational Threat Intelligence
- About studying threat actors
- Gain information about who they are, motivations, tactics, techniques and procedures.
- Technical and not easily automated.

### Tactical Threat Intelligence
- Technical in nature, immediate value to the organization
- Shared in the form of IOC’s
- Used by a human analyst or security tools.

## Why Threat Intelligence is valuable.
### Cyber Threat Context
In Depth threat analysis could determine future attacks and help to put defensive measures in place to protect against them

### Incident Prioritization
Threat intelligence can give context to incident responders to allow them to make a decision on which incidents are the highest priorities.

### Investigation enrichment
Giving context to a situation can greatly affect what is done. If there is an IP scanning your network, it could be harmless. But if the IP has been flagged before this indicates it is very important to look into.

### Information Sharing
Sharing information with other organizations can help to get a better picture of the current threat landscape. This would allow companies to better monitor what threats are likely to happen and gather more IoCs to analyse their systems for existing problems

## Types of threat intelligence
### SIGINT
- Signal Intelligence
- Interception of radio and broadcast communication to gather intelligence
- Can break down into comint and elint
- COMINT - communications intelligence (message and voice)
- ELINT - electronic intelligence, gathered from equipment not directly used for communication (guidance communication, radars)
- Usually used in electronic warfare

### OSINT
- Open source intelligence
- Gathered from any public information source

### HUMINT
- Gathered through other humans
- Common in espionage

### GEOINT
- Geospatiol intelligence
- Used by militaries to access the best attack and defensive positions

## The Future of Threat Intelligence
- Tenable are coming up with a solution to how threat intelligence can be rated
- CVEs are identifiers of reported vulnerabilities
- CVSS is a method of scoring different vulnerabilities.
- The issue with CVSS is they are not company specific. Also very critical vulnerabilities could be extremely technical so won't be carried out by many hackers
- Predictive prioritization will combine vulnerability data with threat intelligence so it will change the CVSS rating depending on the current threat lasndscape.
