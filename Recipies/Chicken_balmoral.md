## Ingredients
- 4 free-range chicken supremes or large skin-on chicken breasts (see Know-how)
- 100g haggis 
- 1 tsp freshly picked thyme leaves
- Knob of butter
- Splash of oil
- Neeps and tatties (mashed swede and mashed potato) and steamed seasonal greens to serve
### For the whisky cream sauce
- 100ml chicken stock
- Splash whisky to taste
- 200ml double cream
### You’ll also need…
- 4-8 cocktail sticks; ovenproof frying pan

## Method
1. Heat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6. Cut each chicken breast almost in half horizontally to form a pocket. Mash the haggis and thyme together in a small bowl with a fork (no need to season). Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions, then use it to stuff the breasts. Use 1 or 2 cocktail sticks to secure the filling inside.
2. Heat the butter and oil in the frying pan over a medium-high heat, add the chicken skin-side down and cook for about 5 minutes or until golden brown. Turn the chicken breasts over and brown the other sides for 3 minutes. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast for 15-18 minutes or until just cooked through (the juices will run clear when the chicken breast is pierced with a skewer in the thickest part).
3. Remove the chicken and put on a plate to rest, loosely covered with foil to keep warm. Put the pan back on the hob, pour in the stock and use a wooden spoon to scrape up all the tasty browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Stir in a splash of whisky and the cream, then season with salt and plenty of black pepper, adding a little more whisky to taste. Serve the chicken with neeps and tatties, steamed seasonal greens and a spoonful of whisky cream sauce.
