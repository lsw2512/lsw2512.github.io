## Ingredients
Serves: 4

Metric Cups
- 1 teaspoon garlic infused olive oil
- 4 rashers streaky bacon
- 4 chicken escalopes (approx. 125g / 4oz each)
- 100 millilitres white wine

##Method
1. Put the oil in a frying pan and add the streaky bacon.
2. Fry till the streaky bacon is crisp and the pan is full of bacon juices. Remove the streaky bacon to a piece of foil, wrap it and set it aside for a moment.
3. Fry the chicken for about 2 minutes a side, until there is no pinkness when you cut into a piece. Make sure the pan's hot so that the escalopes catch a little, turning beautifully bronze.
4. Remove the chicken to a serving plate and quickly crumble the streaky bacon you've set aside into the pan, then pour in the wine, letting everything bubble up, and, finally, pour over the chicken pieces.
