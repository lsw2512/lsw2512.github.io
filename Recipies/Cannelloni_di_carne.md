## Ingredients

    8 dried cannelloni tubes
    10g of Parmesan, finely grated

### Beef ragu Ingredients

    3 tbsp of olive oil
    500g of beef mince
    1 onion, finely diced
    2 garlic cloves, sliced
    1 stick of celery, finely diced
    100ml of red wine
    1 bay leaf
    2 400g tins of chopped tomatoes
    75ml of whole milk
    salt
    ground black pepper

### Béchamel sauce Ingredients

    25g of butter
    25g of flour
    1 bay leaf
    380ml of whole milk, warmed
    freshly grated nutmeg
    1 dash of white wine vinegar
    salt

1. Begin by making the filling. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to a large pan.
2. Add the mince and season. Fry until browned
3. Remove the mince from the pan then add the onion, garlic, celery. fry lightly until soft.
4. Add the mince back into the pan along with the wine and bay leaf. Cook until the wine has reduced by half then add the tomatoes and milk. Leave on a low heat to simmer for an hour
5. Meanwhile, prepare the béchamel. Heat the butter and flour in a pan and stir to create a roux. Cook until this is a caramel colour.
6. Whisk in the warm milk bit by bit to avoid lumps. Add the bay leaf, nutmeg and a pinch of salt and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring continuously until thickened.
7. When ready, the ragu should have a thick velvety texture; not too loose to fit in a piping bag, but not too dry otherwise it won't cook the pasta.
8. Preheat an oven to 180°C.
9. If using dried cannelloni tubes, you will need a piping bag to fill them. Once all the cannelloni tubes are filled, transfer to baking dish, top with remaining ragu, bechamel sauce and parmesan cheese.
10. Bake the cannelloni for 40–50 minutes until golden and bubbling.
