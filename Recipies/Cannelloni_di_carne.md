## Ingrdients

    4 fresh lasagne sheets, cut in half widthways, or 8 dried cannelloni tubes
    10g of Parmesan, finely grated

### Beef ragu

    3 tbsp of olive oil
    500g of beef mince, or 250g of beef mince and 250g of pork mince
    1 onion, finely diced
    2 garlic cloves, sliced
    1 stick of celery, finely diced
    100ml of red wine
    1 bay leaf
    2 400g tins of chopped tomatoes
    75ml of whole milk
    salt
    freshly ground black pepper

### Béchamel sauce

    25g of butter
    25g of flour
    1 bay leaf
    380ml of whole milk, warmed
    freshly grated nutmeg
    1 dash of white wine vinegar
    salt

1. Begin by making the filling. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to a large pan and fry off the mince until browned and starting to crisp up a little
2. Remove the mince from the pan then add another tablespoon of oil with the onion, garlic, celery and a pinch of salt. Sweat until soft, about 8 minutes
3. Add the mince back into the pan along with the wine and bay leaf. Cook until the wine has reduced by half then add the tomatoes and milk. Leave on a low heat to simmer for an hour
4. Meanwhile, prepare the béchamel. Heat the butter and flour in a pan and stir to create a paste (this is called a roux). Cook out the roux for a minute or so to avoid a floury taste to your sauce
