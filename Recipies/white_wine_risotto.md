## Ingredients
- 300g risotto rice
- 1tbsp olive oil
- 2-4 sausages, preferably Italian
- 1ltr (1¾pt) warm chicken stock
- 30g (1oz) butter
- 1 large onion, sliced
- 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 1 sprig of thyme
- 1 sprig of rosemary
- Flaked sea salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 150ml (5fl oz) white wine or vermouth 
- 50g (1¾ oz) Parmesan cheese, freshly grated, plus extra to serve
- 2tbsp finely chopped parsley, to serve        

## Method            
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C/fan 180°C/gas 6. Heat the olive oil in a large, shallow pan, then add the sausages and brown them thoroughly. Transfer the sausages to a roasting tin and put them in the oven for 20 minutes.
2. Pour the stock into a saucepan and keep it on a low heat. Add half the butter to the sausage pan. Add the onion and fry it gently on a medium to high heat until it starts to colour – the aim is to lightly caramelise it to add sweetness.
3. Add the garlic, herbs and rice, then cook for a minute, stirring continuously, until the rice is glossy. Season with salt and pepper. Pour in the wine or vermouth, bring it to the boil and reduce by at least two-thirds.
4. Add a ladleful of warm stock, then stir over a medium heat until the liquid has been absorbed. Keep adding the stock, a ladleful at a time, making sure each one is absorbed before adding the next. Continue until you have used up all the stock – this should take about 20 minutes. The rice should be swollen but still have bite.
5. Remove the sausages from the oven and cut them into small pieces. Check the consistency of the risotto – it should fall back in waves when you drag your spoon through it. Add the sausage to the risotto, then beat in the remaining butter and the Parmesan. Fish out the sprigs of thyme and rosemary. Sprinkle with parsley and serve with a bowl of grated Parmesan.
