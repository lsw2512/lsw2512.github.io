## Ingredients
- 1/2 pound lasagna noodles
- 1/2 pound ground Italian sausage
- 3 1/2 cups prepared tomato or marinara sauce
- 1 teaspoon salt (plus more, to taste)
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 cup water
- 1 cup ricotta cheese
- 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese (plus more for garnish)
- 1/3 cup parmesan cheese (grated)
- Garnish: Fresh parsley (chopped)

## Steps to Make It

1. Break up the lasagna noodles into large, bite-sized pieces. 
2. Add the ground sausage to a large pan (that has a lid) and break into chunks. Heat the sausage on medium-high heat without stirring until nice caramelization forms. This takes about 3 minutes. Use a wooden spoon to break the sausage into smaller crumbles and continue cooking until completely cooked through.
3. Add the tomato sauce, salt, and dried basil to the sausage in the pan. Add the water. Stir and heat on medium-low heat until just warmed through.
4. Add the lasagna noodles and press them into the sauce as best as you can. Try to submerge as many of the noodles as possible.
5. Place the lid onto the pan and cook for 15-20 minutes or until the noodles are soft and have absorbed most of the sauce. Stir every few minutes to ensure even cooking of all of the noodles, adding a little more sauce and/or water if the mixture gets too dry.
6. Once the noodles have cooked, stir in the ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, and parmesan cheese until evenly distributed. Allow the cheeses to melt. Add more salt to taste.
7. Top with chopped parsley and more cheese if you wish. Serve and enjoy.
