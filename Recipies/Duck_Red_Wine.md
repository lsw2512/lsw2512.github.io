## Ingredients
- 4 ducks legs
- Â½ tsp five spice powder
- bunch of rosemary sprigs
- 4 fat garlic cloves
- half a bottle of red wine
- 2 tbsp redcurrant or quince jelly

## Method
1. Heat oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Put the duck legs in one layer in a roasting tin on a bed of rosemary sprigs and garlic cloves. Sprinkle it with salt and five-spice powder. Roast for 1 hr.
2. Bring the wine and jelly to a gentle simmer, stirring to dissolve the jelly, then continue to simmer for 5 mins. When the duck has been cooking for an hour, remove from the oven and spoon off almost all the fat (save it for roast potatoes), then pour the wine mixture around it and return to the oven for 10-15 mins to finish cooking and reduce the sauce.
