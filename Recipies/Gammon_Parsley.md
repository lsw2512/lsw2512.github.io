## Ingredients
Serves: 2

Metric Cups
- 2 teaspoons garlic infused olive oil
- 2 gammon steaks (approx 200g / 7oz each)
- 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
- 4 tablespoons water
- freshly-ground pepper
- 2 teaspoons honey
- 4 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh parsley

## Method
1. Heat the garlic oil in a large-ish, heavy-based frying pan and, when hot, add the gammon steaks and cook for about 3 minutes a side. Remove to two warmed dinner plates.
2. Take the pan off the heat. Whisk the vinegar with the water, pepper and honey and quickly throw into the (still hot) pan along with most of the parsley. Swirl, stir and scrape to mix, and then pour over the gammon steaks.
3. Add the vegetable of your choice, and sprinkle the rest of the parsley over the two plates of food before tucking in.
