## Ingredients
- 12 slices quality prosciutto
- 4 higher-welfare pork chops , French trimmed and all fat removed
- 1 small red apple , cored and sliced
- 75 g Stilton cheese , crumbled
- 4 large rosemary sprigs , to skewer

## Method
1. Wrapping the meat in prosciutto with apple and blue cheese really perks up the humble pork chop
2. Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Lay out 3 slices of the prosciutto so they overlap. Repeat with the rest of the prosciutto so you have 4 piles.
3. Put a frying pan over a high heat. Season the chops well with salt and pepper, then sear in the hot pan on both sides. Place a seared chop on top of each pile of prosciutto. Divide the sliced apple and Stilton between the prosciutto piles, on top of the pork.
4. Wrap the prosciutto around each of the pork, apple and Stilton parcels to hold it all in place. Secure each with a rosemary sprig. Place the prosciutto parcels on a baking tray and bake in the oven for 15 minutes, or until the pork is cooked through. Serve with mashed potato and greens and cooking juices from the parcels.
