## Thai Red Curry Paste
### Ingredients
- 4 medium red chillies
- 4 level teaspoons coriander seeds
- 2 level teaspoons cumin seeds
- 4 stems lemon grass, trimmed and chopped
- 2 level teaspoons grated fresh ginger    
- 4 shallots
- 6 cloves garlic
- grated zest and juice 2 limes
- 2 level dessert spoons hot paprika

### Method
1. Begin by splitting the chillies in half and removing and discarding the seeds.
2. Now take a small frying pan and pre-heat it over a medium heat, then add the coriander and cumin seeds and toss them around in the dry pan to roast them and draw out their flavours.
3. After about 5 minutes tip them into a mortar and crush them finely to a powder. Now simply place the chillies, spices and all the other ingredients in a food processor and whiz them to a coarse paste.
