3. Stir in the rocket and basil leaves and turn off the heat. Set aside
4. Cook the rigatoni in salted boiling water until al dente. Drain and toss with a little olive oil to stop the pasta sticking together

6. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C/gas mark 4
7. Pipe some filling into each rigatoni tube and place in a baking dish
8. Pour half of the sauce over the pasta, giving a gentle stir to coat evenly, then pour over the rest of the sauce. Spread the torn mozzarella over the top then cover with a generous grating of Pecorino. Bake in the oven for 25 minutes
9. Season with freshly ground black pepper and garnish with fresh basil
