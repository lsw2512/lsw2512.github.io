## Ingrdients
Tomato sauce

    olive oil
    1 onion, diced
    2 garlic cloves, sliced
    2 sprigs of fresh thyme
    150ml of red wine
    800g of tinned San Marzano tomatoes, chopped
    1 handful of rocket
    1 handful of basil leaves
    salt
    pepper

Filling

    150g of ricotta
    100g of Provolone cheese, grated
    75g of mozzarella cheese, grated
    100g of mortadella, finely diced
    1 egg
    salt
    pepper

To assemble

    300g of rigatoni pasta
    50g of mozzarella cheese, torn into pieces
    pecorino, grated
    basil leaves

1. To begin, make the tomato sauce. Sauté the onion and garlic in a splash of oil until soft. Add the thyme and red wine
2. Reduce the wine by three quarters. Add the tomatoes and simmer for 25 minutes, until the sauce has thickened
3. Stir in the rocket and basil leaves and turn off the heat. Set aside
4. Cook the rigatoni in salted boiling water until al dente. Drain and toss with a little olive oil to stop the pasta sticking together
5. Mix the filling ingredients together in a bowl, season with salt and pepper and transfer to a piping bag
6. Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas mark 4
7. Pipe some filling into each rigatoni tube and place the filled pasta in a baking dish
8. Pour half of the sauce over the pasta, giving a gentle stir to coat evenly, then pour over the rest of the sauce. Spread the torn mozzarella over the top then cover with a generous grating of Pecorino. Bake in the oven for 25 minutes
9. Season with freshly ground black pepper and garnish with fresh basil
