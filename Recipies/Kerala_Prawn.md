## Ingredients
- 2 red chillies split, cut into quarters lengthwise and seeded
- 1 small red onion , chopped
- 2.5cm piece of fresh root ginger , peeled and chopped
- 1 tbsp vegetable or sunflower oil
- 1 tsp black mustard seed
- ½ tsp fenugreek seeds
- 14 curry leaves , fresh or dried
- ½ tsp turmeric
- ½ tsp cracked black peppercorns
- 250g jumbo prawns , leave some with their tails on if you like
- 150ml reduced-fat coconut milk
### To serve
- a squeeze of lime
- chopped fresh coriander , plus a sprig or two
- freshly boiled basmati rice

## Method
1. In a food processor, blitz the chillies, onion and ginger with 3 tbsp water into a smoothish paste – you may need to scrape it down the sides.

2. Heat the oil in a heavy pan or wok. When hot, toss in the mustard and fenugreek seeds, and curry leaves – they’ll crackle and pop – and fry for 10 seconds. Add the onion paste, turn the heat down a tad and cook without colouring for about 5 minutes. Splash in some water if it starts to catch.

3. Add the turmeric and cracked peppercorns and stir the spices around for a few seconds before tipping in the prawns. Pour in the coconut milk and bring to a simmer, stirring all the time. The milk will take on a yellow colour from the turmeric. Cook for 1 minute until everything’s heated through. Squeeze over some lime, sprinkle with fresh coriander and serve with rice.
