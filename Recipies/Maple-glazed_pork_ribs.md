## Ingredients
- olive oil
- 1.6 kg higher-welfare pork spare ribs, cut into 8 pieces (ask your butcher to do this)
- 2 onions
- 3 large cloves of garlic
- 120 ml maple syrup
- 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 480 ml organic chicken stock

## Method
1. Preheat the oven to 180ÂºC/gas 4.
2. Season the ribs with sea salt and black pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a lidded, ovenproof dish over a medium-high heat. Add the ribs, and brown in 2 batches, on all sides for 7 to 10 minutes.
3. Peel and finely dice the onions. Peel the garlic.
4. Drain any excess oil from the pan, add the onion and garlic and season with salt and pepper. Cook for around 4 minutes, or until the onion begins to brown.
5. Add the maple syrup and bring to the boil, then reduce until the bubbles become slow and thick.
6. Add the vinegar and cook for about 3 minutes, until well reduced. Add the chicken stock, return the ribs to the pan and bring to the boil.
7. Put the lid on and place in the oven for 2 hours, or until the ribs are tender and flake with a fork, turning halfway through, and removing the lid for the last 30 minutes. Check on the ribs regularly to make sure the pan has enough liquid, adding 50 ml of water at a time to keep the juices from running dry and burning.
8. Serve the maple-glazed pork with your favourite vegetables.
