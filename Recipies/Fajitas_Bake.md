## Ingredients                                    
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 6 boneless skinless chicken thighs, or breasts cut into 1" to 2" pieces
- 4 bell peppers, sliced (vary the colours to make it pretty!)    
- 1 small onion, sliced                    
- 1 taco seasoning packet        
- 1 cup sour cream            
- 4 oz of cream cheese, softened                    
- 2 cups cheddar cheese, grated                    
- optional: garnish with avocado or guacamole, sour cream, salsa. For spicy lovers add heat with hot sauce.                    

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Over medium heat, saute the chicken in olive oil until the chicken is done. Remove from the skillet and set aside.
2. Add onions and peppers and saute until tender.
3. Add chicken back to the pan and stir in taco seasoning, sour cream, and cream cheese. Mix well.
4. Sprinkle with cheese and bake in the oven for 20 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly.
