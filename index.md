My Name is luke, but I go online by lsw2512. I am interested in cybersecurity, particualy offensive security but have knowledge in other areas like blue team. Currently I am working as an IT Administrator, but I am mainly handling the cybersecurity of the company. This is mainly purple team work as I am both looking for vulnerabilities, fixing issues and monitoring our defences.

This webpage is a collection of notes I have make and knowledge I have learnt. This isn't entirely for cybersecurity as I have defferent food and cocktail recipies which i have found or created so its easy to find them and to share with others easily.
