## Introduction to sock puppets
- Misrepresentation of who you are - fake account, alternative identity.
- Used to not let the person know you're looking into them.
- Never used on a device that belongs to you
- Need to have a fake history to look legitimate

## Creating sock puppets

Two types:
- Fully fake account with full history
- Known sock accounts - respected fake personality where no one knows the real person behind it.
