## Ingredients
- 1 bar spoon (or 1 teaspoon) superfine sugar
- 1¾ ounces white rum
-¾ ounce fresh lime juice
- ½ ounce simple syrup
-1 lime

## Preparation
### Step 1
Combine sugar, rum, lime juice, and simple syrup in a cocktail shaker; stir until sugar dissolves, about 20 seconds. Fill shaker with ice, cover, and shake vigorously until outside of shaker is very cold, about 20 seconds. Place a large ice cube in a coupe glass; strain cocktail through a Hawthorne strainer or a slotted spoon into glass.

### Step 2
Using a small serrated knife, remove a 1" strip of peel from lime (some white pith is okay); it should be stiff enough to provide some resistance when bent. Twist over drink to express oils; discard. Garnish with a lime twist.
