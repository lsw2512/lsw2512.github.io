Network file system This is a service used so that people can access certain parts of a remote filesystem. If this is badly configured it could mean that you grant excessive access to users.

If the service is on its default port you can run this command to see what the filesystem is sharing

showmount -e 192.168.1.109

Then you can mount the filesystem to your machine using the following command:

mount 192.168.1.109:/ /tmp/NFS

mount -t 192.168.1.109:/ /tmp/NFS

Now we can go to /tmp/NFS and check out /etc/passwd, and add and remove files.

This can be used to escalate privileges if it is not correctly configured.
