This Website is mainly to keep organised notes for pentesting.

I work as an IT Administrator and mainly focus on the Cyber Security for the company. I studied Cyber security and Networks (BSc hons) and acheived a 2:1 (first devidion). In my free time, When I am not doing any comuter things, I like to watch horror films, do DIY and wood work, cooking, and outdoor activites.
